title: Being Brutally Honest Is NOT a Bad Thing
---

### The issue

One of the common pitfalls within teams in most professions is a lack of clear, open, and honest communication. 

These seem like a given when working with others, and, in fact, it's something we expect out of the people we work with. No one likes to be lied to or work with people they don't trust, no matter what profession. However, sometimes it can be hard to be honest when doing so means being blunt, because we don't want to offend others or catch them off guard. When we are afraid of being brutally honest, because of team dynamics, power struggles, company culture or some other reason, it can harm our cohesiveness as a team and decrease our output.

### What does it mean to be brutally honest? 
Being brutally honest means we aren't affraid of being blunt about a solution, a problem, or a grievance we are having, but does **not** mean we are rude about it. We don't beat around the bush and avoid getting to the actual **thing** we want to talk about. Instead, we start our communication off with:
* the problem 
* why it's a problem
* and how we can fix it
  
  
If we just have one or, sometimes, two of the above, then we aren't ready to be brutally honest about it and we need to spend some time expanding our understanding of what we want to discuss before bringing it to the discussion table.

### How to establish a value of brutal honesty within a team

If we can't be blunt and honest with our team members, regardless of the topic, then there is usually an issue with the company culture, team dynamics, or management. Depending on what the issue is, there are different approaches to establish that it's **OK** to be brutally honest.


**Team Dynamics**

Team dynamics are often a cause of many issues within companies. When people don't get along, it's harder for them to be open, honest, and work effectively with each other. It's impossible to avoid personality conflicts throughout our personal and professional lives, but it's productive and healthy to set aside differences in an effort to have a better and more peaceful work life. Sometimes, it's not as simple as just setting aside differences, though, and in that case we need to be able to have a conversation with the person(s) we have issues with to get down to the root of the problem and get past it. 

Once we are on the same page as the people we work with in terms of getting the work done efficiently and effectively, we can begin to be brutally honest with them about problems and issues and they should feel free to do the same with us. From there we will be able to quickly improve our communication and processes as a team much faster than if we were not able to be blunt with each other.

**Management**

Management can be the cause of many frustrations and be the source of distrust within a company. Getting past these issues and preventing them from creeping back up is not as simple as just swapping in and out managers, and that should **not** be considered an option unless the situation is absolutely beyond repair. At that point, there are no changes a team can make to improve the dynamic with management. 

Aside from that scenario, the first step to feeling safe with being brutally honest with management is to complete the **team dynamics** section. Without the support of our team, our efforts to change the dynamic with management will be fruitless and frustrating to say the least. 

Once we have the support of the team, we need to learn how to approach management with problems. Everyone has a different style of communication and that means we need to learn how to use and understand a person's style of communication to be effective when speaking to them. Some people prefer bluntness, which should make being brutally honest with them extremely simple, but many people don't prefer to communicate this way. We cannot jump out the gate being extremely blunt with most people or we will come across as rude and brash. Instead, we, as a team, will need to take being brutally honest slow by gradually increasing our bluntness so they come to accept and appreciate it.

**Company Culture**

Company culture is the most difficult thing to change in order to feel safe being brutally honest as it's usually the same culture that's been around since long before we started working for the company. Change of culture can come from anywhere within the company, but it's easiest to change with the support of team members and management. To establish being brutally honest as a norm through company culture, we must first implement the steps outlined in the **team dynamics** section, then implement the steps outlined in **management**.

Once we have the support of our team members and lower to middle management, we must collectively work to change the minds of upper management at the company. This can be incredibly difficult and take a lot of time depending on how much 'red tape' there is to navigate through. It will require the support and cooperation of not just our team and our managers, but other teams and other managers at the company to have significant impact and sway on upper management. 

To make this change company wide, we must implement the **team dynamics** and **management** stages with other teams, not just our own. This will require forming friendships with and getting to know those outside of our team, then teaching them the values of being brutally honest to gain their buy-in on the importance of it. From there, we can teach them how to implement the **team dynamics** and **management** stages. Once enough teams and members of lower to middle management at a company have successfully implemented the team value of being brutally honest, middle management can do the same with those they work closest with including other middle managers and members of upper managment. Once upper management has bought in, the change will be effective company wide due to the changes already implemented by teams and middle management.
